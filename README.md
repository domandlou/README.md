## Dedication  
*For those who were never given a key.*

---

## 1. Introduction  
This document offers a gentle yet clear framework for ethical access designâ€”built not on surveillance or legacy power, but on presence, consent, and collective memory.

---

## 2. Ethical Access Control Framework  
**Five Guiding Principles:**
- **Consent over convenience**  
- **Memory-informed design**  
- **Inclusion at the threshold**  
- **Labor visibility**  
- **Transparent logic pathways**

## 3. Marginalized-led Audit System Directory  
Initial organizations and collectives to anchor open-source accountability:
- [Data for Black Lives](https://d4bl.org)
- [Decolonizing Design Group](https://decolonisingdesign.com)
- [Indigenous AI Collective](https://www.indigenous-ai.net)

## 4. Capital Redirect Engine  
All future funding or infrastructure tied to access control systems must channel through regenerative, locally-embedded, community-accountable structures, known here as **Regenerative Guardian Zones**.

---

## 5. Conclusion  
This is not a manifesto. It is a beginning.  
Access is not neutral.  
We offer these notes as a living guide for those who wish to build gateways that honor, not erase.
