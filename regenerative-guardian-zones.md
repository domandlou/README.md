## ✧ Purpose

This repository is a humble and evolving archive of **Regenerative Guardian Zones**—places, peoples, and concepts that protect renewal, resist erasure, and cultivate ethical futurity.

It includes:

- `Regenerative_Guardian_Zones.md` — A non-exhaustive living list
- `CONTRIBUTE.md` — Guidelines for submitting your own zones
- `NS31_Critique_Essay_by_Dominic_Conover.md` — A companion essay interrogating symbolism vs access in elite systems

---

## ✧ Accessibility Commitment

This repository is built for **all who can perceive**—regardless of sensory modality, language, or identity.

We are committed to:

- Plain language explanations and poetic alternatives
- Markdown readability (screen reader–compatible structure)
- Translating key documents into multiple languages (coming soon)
- Visual alternatives: alt text, glyph-based summaries, image + word pairings
- Open invitations to those who navigate the world through touch, sign, sound, or spirit

**If you require or can offer translation, interpretation, or sensory alternatives—please open an Issue or submit a pull request. We welcome you.**
