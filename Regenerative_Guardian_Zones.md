This file documents a **non-exhaustive collection of Regenerative Guardian Zones**—geographies, communities, bioregions, and symbolic thresholds that act as *living ecosystems of healing, resistance, reciprocity, and renewal*.

These zones are not always protected by law.  
Sometimes they are protected by **ritual**, **memory**, or the **integrity of the people who love them**.

## **Imagined + Symbolic Zones**

These are zones we believe exist—or must.  
They may not have maps, but they guide us:

- **Mirrorball Rivers**: Where memory runs clear and glittering, guarded by those who still feel
- **August Ritual Circles**: Where time is non-linear and healing occurs in spirals
- **The Last Honest Library**: A shifting, hidden archive that refuses to forget
- **Crescent Garden Loops**: Tended by those who remember how to sit in stillness and replant

## **Acknowledgment of the Unseen**

We affirm:
- Not all guardian zones are visible on satellite maps.
- Some regenerate in silence.
- Some are people themselves.
- Some will only be known once they are gone.

This document will evolve.  
Additions, amendments, and reverent speculation are welcome.
